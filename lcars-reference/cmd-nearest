Warp distance is the sum of all warp paths. You can divide the Warp distance by the ship warp speed (details Tab > Utility section) to calculate the warp time (excluding impulse time) between 'from' and 'to' systems.

The Ship's "Warp Range" is actually the "Maximum Inter-System Warp Hop Distance" and not "[Total] Warp Range".
