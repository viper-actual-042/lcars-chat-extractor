 COMMAND HELP
= Route / Course command =

Find quickest path between 2 systems

Command ::
!route

Aliases ::
!course, !engage, !wf, !wayfind, !wayfinding
Syntax:
!<command> <from_system> <direction> <to_system> <warp> <filters>

From/To System Name ::
 * Full/partial System names supported

Direction ::
 * Required
 * to, >, >>, ->, from, <, <<, <- for path ordering

Warp ::
 * find best route for maximum ship maximum
   inter-system warp hop distance

Filters ::
 * Info     - summary list or detailed stats and info
Usage Examples:
!route zeta polis to kol ran = show quicket path
!nav wolf to babel           = direct route (warp 47)
!wolf to babel 40            = max warp 40 alt route
!p'jem to Groomb info
        = P'Jem to Groombridge 34 with system data
Notes:
Warp distance is the sum of all warp paths. You can divide the Warp distance by the ship warp speed (details Tab > Utility section) to calculate the warp time (excluding impulse time) between 'from' and 'to' systems.

The Ship's "Warp Range" is actually the "Maximum Inter-System Warp Hop Distance" and not "[Total] Warp Range".
