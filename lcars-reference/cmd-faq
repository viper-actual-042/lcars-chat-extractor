HOW TO CALCULATE TIME & COST REDUCTIONS
Research is dependent on multiple factors for the net (final) cost and time. So it will be different for everyone subject to how you upgrade.


For costs, the following is used:

Building
- Astronaut Studio

Station Research Tab
- Research Optimization  [Column: 9] 

Outlaw Research Tab
- Crystal Research Efficiency  [Column: 12] 
- Gas Research Efficiency  [Column: 20] 
- Ore Research Efficiency  [Column: 24] 

Station Research Tab
- Optimised Research  [Column: 15] 
- Efficient Research  [Column: 7] 

Territory Capture Zone
- Research Efficiency Enhancer [Zones: Framtid, Otima] 

For time it takes, the following is used:

Building
- R&D Department

Station Research Tab
- Prime Research  [Column: 6] 
- Research Expert  [Column: 16] 

Territory Capture Zone
- Research Speed Enhancer [Zones: Hrojost, Roshar] 

We have set up a spreadsheet to make this easy for you. Simply select your levels, enter the values and it does the rest!
