This service is essentially your own terminal to the database via Direct Messages with the bot.

It will provide exactly the same results as the current Access Terminals do but you will not share that workspace with other users so the results will not be scrolled until you enter a new command.

Command ::
!hello
Usage Examples:
!hello
Notes:
Bear in mind that you will not be able to flag a moderator for help; these terminal sessions are truly private.

Should you need assistance, please return to LCARS 2.0 discord and seek help. Do not use direct messaging to moderators as there is no certainty regarding their availability in your time of need.
