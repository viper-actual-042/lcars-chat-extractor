#### LCARS_RESPONSE:
*The Romulans built the Augur class battleships as rapid-response vessels to react to attacks on their territory. These sleek warbirds come packaged with side-mounted disruptors and added armor plates across their wingspan.*
*With hostilities on the rise, the Klingon Empire knows that they will need to protect their precious mining operations. Sneering at the Federation’s trickery and the Romulans’s cowardice, the Empire have designed a ship that will guarantee their economic dominance: The B’Chor. This gargantuan vessel features fourteen compartmentalized cargo holds for storing materials, each one protected by a seven inch Tritanium hull. While their enemies flee at the first sight of danger, the B’Chor will stand strong.*
*The Klingon B’Rel class is a small explorer starship built entirely for short range excursions. Unusually, for a Klingon vessel, it is relatively light on weaponry and does not see a lot of combat maneuvers.*
*The Bortas class battleship is traditionally only found as a part of the Klingon Imperial Fleet and is one of the most recognizable ships in the Empire. Many of the flagships of the Empire over the years have been from this class and they have often been commanded by Chancellors throughout the years.*
*Much like the crew that operated it, the Botany Bay is a relic from humanity’s distant past. Built on Earth in the late 20th century, it was intended to be humanity’s foray into deep space exploration. The vessel’s engines utilized revolutionary nuclear fission technology that was believed to be a completely self-sufficient energy source and its X-25 network array could gather data at an astounding rate.*
*The elite Centurion class is a Romulan explorer most typically found in Imperial fleets. Praetor Bervas was once a General in the fleet and led from a Centurion. The battle that gained him the prestige to stake his claim for leadership of the Star Empire was when he led a squadron into Klingon territory to reclaim the Narendra system, destroying dozens of the Klingon Chancellor’s finest warriors in one ambush.*
*Historically utilized by the Klingon Imperial Defense Force, the D3 class of vessel was used primarily for escort and bombardment missions up until the 2150s. It was then re-classified as an Interceptor and has since been widely adopted as a forward scout. Its nuclear fusion impulse engines allow it to move quickly in and out of danger, and it is armed with light disruptors should it need to engage a foe larger and more heavily armored than itself. While not as well armed as its cousin, the D4 class, the D3 is still a reliable and efficient vessel that should never be underestimated.*
*The iconic Klingon D4 class is a tiny fighter vessel used to intercept and destroy enemies. The D4 has many common uses, such as a troop carrier for infiltration and extraction missions. Squadrons of D4 patrol the surface of Kronos as an elite defense force capable of chasing down, surrounding and eliminating any threat.*
*The Fortunate is an original ECS freighter, built for a high carry capacity and structural integrity at the cost of interior comfort, speed and weapon functionality. As an entry level freighter, the ECS Fortunate is very popular, but limited in its capabilities.*
*The Horizon freighter was part of the ECS's privately owned fleet and used for the transport of all types of goods, ranging from hazardous material to passengers on long-haul journeys. Originally built in the early 22nd century, they started service as pre-warp vessels but have since been maintained and upgraded for low-warp travel.*

---

#### ==========!t1 ships cont'd===============


ENVOY (Neutral)   2★   Common   Survey
*The Envoy is an advanced ECS freighter with significant improvements over its older cousin, the J-Class. With more cargo holds and better internal systems, the Envoy is equipped for deep space expeditions.*




FERENGI D'VOR (Neutral)   3★   Epic   Survey
*As war between the galaxy’s major factions looms over the horizon, many are left wondering about who will come out on top? What state will our galaxy be in when it ends? Then there are those enterprising few who look past these petty concerns and into profit. For those crafty minds, there is no more suitable vessel than the Ferengi D’Vor. Developed by the renowned Urata Manufacturing as a way to cheat the Latinum exchange, the D’Vor comes mounted with a Dx100 mining laser, configured specifically for the extraction of raw latinum. No other vessel in existence can gather the precious material as efficiently, a testament to the engineering prowess and latinum lust of its creators. In a time of war and strife, nothing will generate profit like the D’Vor. After all, war is good for business.*




GLADIUS (Romulan)   3★   Rare   Interceptor
*The Gladius class interceptor is a classic Romulan design, built for increased mobility and rapid change of direction. The slim hull allows for an increased chance of evading torpedo fire while on an attack run.*




HEGH'TA (Klingon)   4★   Epic   Interceptor
*This Klingon interceptor class was designed with intimidation in mind. Its aggressively shaped wing pylons are intentionally designed to look familiar to Klingon warrior battle armor. The Hegh’Ta usually fight in packs and form a core ingredient of any strong Klingon fleet.*




HIJACKED D3 CLASS (Klingon)   3★   Uncommon   Interceptor
*The Augments were rarely impressed by Klingon technology. It lacked the level of grace and efficiency that they were used to in their own weaponry. However, even they could not ignore the technical ingenuity put into the D3 vessel. An older ship once thought to be obsolete, the D3 was refitted and repurposed by the Klingons into a great power. For the Augments, there was no better metaphor for their own experience in this strange, new galaxy.*




HIJACKED LEGIONARY (Romulan)   3★   Uncommon   Battleship
*In true Romulan fashion, the Legionary class Battleship was slowly phased out of frontline service in favor of the more powerful Augur class. While they were quick to abandon this robust and reliable vessel, the Augments were more than happy to adopt it for their own forces. The Augments know the true value of underestimated technology, and nothing is a better example than the Legionary.*




HIJACKED USS MAYFLOWER (Federation)   3★   Uncommon   Explorer
*For the Augments, the opportunity to turn Starfleet’s technology against them was a satisfying turn of events. Their new Mayflower flies Augment colors, a blatant insult to their most hated enemies. Joaquin took the time to update the Mayflower’s nacelles, greatly reducing power drain during long voyages.*




ISS JELLYFISH (Neutral)   4★   Rare   Explorer
*The ISS Jellyfish is a testament to the technological prowess of the Terran Empire. Far more versatile than its counterpart in our universe, this Jellyfish uses an experimental dark matter warp drive, capable of travelling vast distances quickly and without appearing on enemy scanners. Originally intended as an espionage vessel, it would allow the Empire to spy on its allies and root out dissent before it began. It is also equipped with powerful T-38 Disruptor cannons, making it more than capable of wiping out rebellious activity whenever it is encountered.

The ISS Jellyfish was to be the pride of the Terran Empire, a symbol of their cunning and omniscience. However, the Empire never came into possession of the ship. Spock had other plans for his prized creation...*




JELLYFISH (Federation)   2★   Rare   Explorer
*The Jellyfish is a scout ship from the future and another dimension. It was once piloted by Ambassador Spock on his mission to save Romulus from destruction in the Prime reality. Since its arrival in this dimension, the Jellyfish has been extensively studied by Federation scientists for its extremely advanced technology. Despite it being a high-tech vessel, the Jellyfish was designed as a science vessel and has relatively weak defenses and is now commonly used as a fast Explorer.*




K'T'INGA (Klingon)   4★   Uncommon   Battleship
*A sister class of ship to the Bortas, the K’T’inga is a Klingon battleship with huge arsenal of torpedo launchers. The main launcher is positioned right at the central section of the bow, below the bridge, giving the Captain of each K’T’inga as close a view of every volley from the main launcher.*

#### ==========!t1 ships cont'd===============


K'VORT (Klingon)   3★   Rare   Survey
*The Klingons retrofitted a standard cargo hauler with design improvements from an early human transport vessel to create their new warp-capable Survey vessels.*




KEHRA (Neutral)   3★   Common   Interceptor
*The Kehra is a Tellarite interceptor named after one of the moons that orbits Tellar Prime. These vessels were at the forefront of the Tellarite conflict with the Andorians and later the Romulan Star Empire in the mid 22nd century. The Kehra has gone through few iterations over the following century and is still one of the main designs in use by the Tellarites in their local defense forces.*




KORINAR (Klingon)   4★   Rare   Explorer
*The central column of strength in the Klingon Defense Force, the Korinar class is most prevalent in the Kronos system as the eyes and ears of the Chancellor in local space. A formidable reactionary vessel, the Korinar is a strong all-rounder.*




KUMARI (Neutral)   3★   Common   Battleship
*The Kumari is an Andorian battle cruiser class named after the legendary Andorian Imperial Guard ship that assisted Earth’s mission to unravel the mystery of the Xindi in 2153. The Andorians built so many of these ships in anticipation of all-out war with the Vulcans that many of the older models can be found in large numbers to this day.*




LEGIONARY (Romulan)   3★   Uncommon   Battleship
*The Legionary class Battleship has been in production on Romulus since the early 2100s. Using a prototype forced quantum singularity engine that would later become a mainstay for the Romulan fleet, the Legionary was once one of the most advanced starships on Romulus. Many of its designs eventually made it into the Augur class, which now serves as Romulus’ primary Battleship. With hostilities around the galaxy growing, the Legionary has seen a resurgence within the Romulan fleet, as it makes an ideal support vessel.*




NORTH STAR (Neutral)   3★   Rare   Survey
*The ECS North Star is a freighter and survey vessel that has been in service for almost 100 years. Boomer communities in the mid-2100s favored the North Star for space faring and as a colonization ship. Families and communities were born and raised on vessels of this class for generations and an entire network of trade ships has grown over the years.*




ORION CORVETTE (Neutral)   1★   Common   Battleship
*The Orions use the Corvette as a nimble smuggling vessel, but it is strong enough in a firefight to act as a viable warship. Despite its hard outer shell, the powerful thrusters give the Corvette a deceptively strong maneuverability.*




PHINDRA (Neutral)   2★   Common   Interceptor
*The Phindra Class is Tellarite in origin, now commonly built in mass quantities by Independents, as its sturdy design and capacity for multiple kinetic weapons make it an ideal short range Interceptor.*




PILUM (Romulan)   4★   Rare   Interceptor
*The Pilum class was developed in secret by the Tal Shiar intelligence division of the Romulan Star Empire. Designed with stealth and speed in mind, the Pilum was instrumental in retaining the control of the borders along the Neutral Zone in the early stages of the Cold War.*




REALTA (Neutral)   1★   Common   Explorer
*The Realta Class is a reliable, if old-fashioned Explorer based on early Earth-made starship designs. Due to its simple components and small size, many Realta hulls were commissioned in the early 2100s and have become synonymous with the Independent movement.*

SARCOPHAGUS (Neutral)   3★   Epic   Battleship
*An ancient Klingon ship, revered as holy by the Klingon Empire. The ship is seen as a symbol of all that the Klingons hold dear: brutal power, honour through battle, and an unwavering tenacity. Now in the possession of House T’Kuvma, it is seen as the ship that will lead the Klingons to ultimate victory against those that threaten their empire.*




SEPARATIST D3 CLASS (Klingon)   3★   Uncommon   Interceptor
*When House Antaak broke apart from the Klingon Empire during the Separatist movement, they took whatever they could with them. The D3 class vessel, which was, up until this point, primarily a support vessel for the more robust B’Rel, became their primary combat vessel. Refitted with heavy duty disruptor weapons and housed in a six-inch thick tritanium armor plating, the Separatist D3 is a force to be reckoned with and a testament to the tenacity and ingenuity of House Antaak’s Separatist forces.*




STELLA (Rogue)   3★   Uncommon   Battleship
*The Stella is a marvel of engineering and criminal ingenuity. The vessel is unique in its modularity. Every component works in concert with its siblings, but is also completely self sufficient, allowing a savvy engineer to swap out and upgrade those parts with ease.
This means that the ship can very easily be broken down into its base components and reassembled again. Harry Mudd has taken advantage of this particular element of the ship’s design, breaking it down to avoid detection whenever he pulls off a heist, only to reassemble it with different signatures in another part of the galaxy.
With this ingenious method, Mudd has achieved the dream of every criminal in the galaxy. He has rendered himself untraceable.*




TALLA (Neutral)   2★   Common   Battleship
*This Battleship is an old Andorian design from the mid-2100s that specializes in strong structural armor and a large quantity of energy weapon banks. The ship was named after Talla, the half-Aenar daughter of the historical figure, Commander Shran, as a symbol of the unity of the Andorian and Aenar races as one galactic community.*




TRIBUNE (Romulan)   4★   Epic   Battleship
*The elegant Romulan Tribune class is the most prominent battleship in the Star Empire fleet as the war rages on with the Federation and the Klingons. Mass produced by Reman construction sites, the birdlike feather-plated wing span of the Tribune is gargantuan in breadth and houses a vast array of weaponry for combat situations.*




TURAS (Neutral)   2★   Common   Explorer
*The Turas Class is a heavily modified update of the Realta with significantly more power and capability. This Explorer is common with more advanced Independent groups and a staple addition to many fleets in contested, neutral space.*




USS ANTARES (Federation)   3★   Rare   Survey
*This Federation Survey ship is an updated design of the old Earth Cargo Ship company's Y-Class vessels that dominated the early intergalactic shipping routes to and from Sol.*




USS DISCOVERY (Neutral)   3★   Rare   Explorer
*All things can be understood once they are discovered; the point is to discover them."
This was the motto of the USS Discovery when it was launched into service. Officially designated a Crossfield class science vessel, the Discovery's facilities could accommodate 300 discrete scientific investigations at any one time.
However, Discovery's mission statement would change drastically after the Battle at the Binary Stars in 2256. 
With Starfleet stretched thin and the Klingons advancing toward Federation space, Discovery was pressed into service as a warship, one that would turn the tide of the conflict. The key to Discovery's military success was its unique spore drive, which allowed it to travel galactic distances in the blink of an eye.*




USS ENTERPRISE (Federation)   3★   Epic   Explorer
*The Starfleet flagship, the USS Enterprise, is one in the line of iconic Constitution class starships. These phenomenal spacecraft have become the backbone of a rebuilding and reinvigorated Federation. Each model in the class is fitted with the latest technology the Federation has to offer.*




USS ENTERPRISE A (Federation)   4★   Epic   Explorer
*The USS Enterprise-A stands as both a fond tribute to its fallen predecessor and as a hopeful look into the future. Commissioned by Starfleet and constructed in Yorktown station in 2263, the ship was completed soon after the destruction of the previous Enterprise, which fell at the hands of Krall and his Swarm. The Enterprise-A follows the same basic configuration as its predecessor but was given more than a few notable upgrades. With the trials of the past behind them and the wonders of tomorrow ahead, this magnificent vessel will carry its crew into the far unknowns... To boldly go where no-one has gone before.*

USS FRANKLIN (Neutral)   3★   Uncommon   Explorer
*The USS Franklin is one of Starfleet's most decorated ships, despite having disappeared over 100 years ago. It was the first ever Earth ship capable of reaching warp 4. After many successful missions, the Franklin mysteriously vanished after travelling through the Gagarin Radiation Belt. It was found in the year 2263 by the crew of the Enterprise. They were able to utilize the ship's antiquated technology to defeat Krall and his Swarm.*




USS FRANKLIN-A (Augment)   4★   Uncommon   Explorer
*After the unexpected return of the USS Franklin in 2263, Starfleet began to examine the many upgrades and jury-rigged fixes applied to the ancient vessel by Jaylah. At first, it was decided that the ship be scrapped for materials and a statue made in its honor, but then the Swarm returned.
Zenith’s invasion changed everything. The Franklin was pressed back into service and upgraded by a mysterious Independent Commander to take the fight to the Swarm. They were victorious, if only barely.
It was only a matter of time before Zenith returned, so the decision was made to retrofit the Franklin and bring it up to the modern standard of Starfleet vessels. So it was, the USS Franklin-A was born.
The Franklin-A has been custom-built to combat the Swarm threat. Armed with a special volumetric wavelength amplifier, it is capable of disrupting an entire Swarm cluster in a matter of seconds by overwhelming their shared frequency.*




USS HYDRA (Federation)   4★   Rare   Survey
*The USS Hydra is the Federation’s answer to aggressive Klingon raids on their mining operations. The Hydra is made up of three conjoined saucer sections that can be separated at a moment’s notice. Though only the rearmost saucer has access to Nacelles, the others are fitted with smaller, almost imperceptible impulse engines, allowing each section to make their own escape in the event of an attack. Living up to its name, so long as one head survives, the Hydra can never truly be taken down.*




USS INTREPID (Federation)   3★   Rare   Battleship
*The Intrepid class starship was originally built by Starfleet as a part of the United Earth military fleet and first began service in aid of the Enterprise NX-01 crew’s search for the Xindi. The latest version of this ship is primarily used by the Federation in short range combat to protect border colonies from Klingon ambushes.*




USS KELVIN (Federation)   4★   Uncommon   Interceptor
*The USS Kelvin was the first ship to encounter the Narada in 2233. The ship, under the command of George Kirk, collided with Nero’s in order to allow the escape of its crew. The class lives on under the Kelvin name and because of its age, it has become a common site in contested space for many years, either refitted or in its original guise.*




USS MAYFLOWER (Federation)   3★   Uncommon   Explorer
*The streamlined Mayflower class is designed for speed and efficiency. Starfleet have mounted extra-long nacelles directly under the Mayflower’s saucer section to increase its effectiveness in low orbit planetary scouting missions. The titular USS Mayflower was destroyed by Nero’s Narada in 2258 but many of its sister vessels are still in service today.*




USS NEWTON (Federation)   4★   Rare   Battleship
*The Newton class is named after iconic human scientist, Sir Isaac Newton, a legend of his field on Earth in the 1600s. The eponymous ship, the USS Newton, was destroyed instantly in the Battle of Vulcan by Nero’s mining behemoth, the Narada. The name lives on as the class continues to be built by Starfleet to field the front lines as the war escalates with the Romulans and Klingons.*




USS SALADIN (Federation)   3★   Uncommon   Interceptor
*The Saladin class interceptor is a small Starfleet construction used for dogfighting scenarios, mainly in the defense of outposts and Space Stations. Unlike its older cousin, the Mayflower class, the Saladin relies on a single nacelle and an array of thrusters along the saucer section to provide its maneuverability.*




VAHKLAS (Neutral)   3★   Common   Explorer
*The Vahklas was built as a transport ship by the Vulcans in the early 2100s and has had multiple iterations over the following decades. It is a reliable exploration vessel that was mass produced around Vulcan before the planet’s destruction, making it very commonly used by Independents.*




VALDORE (Romulan)   4★   Uncommon   Explorer
*The prototype Romulan explorer class, the Valdore, is named after the infamous Senator and Admiral Valdore. The ship is an extremely minimalistic vision of Romulan engineering, designed for immense speed at warp and impulse.*

VALKIS (Romulan)   3★   Rare   Survey
*Romulan engineers adopted many design characteristics from rival Federation freighters to create their own brand of Survey ships.*




VI'DAR (Neutral)   3★   Uncommon   Interceptor
*Created in shadow and filled with its creators’ lust for vengeance, the Vi’dar was to be the ultimate weapon of Romulus. Desperate for some defense against the Borg threat, the Romulans fitted their already powerful disruptor weaponry with Borg technology. These tremendous new weapons can tear through even the most durable hull lining, but their real strength lies against a most curious foe: the Borg themselves. The Romulan scientists working on the Vi’dar managed to create a disruptor system with a constantly shifting frequency, making it impossible for Borg ships to adapt their shielding. With a full-scale Borg invasion all but inevitable, the galaxy may very well place their last hopes in this unlikely ally. A ship born of Borg, destined to destroy them.*




VORTA VOR (Romulan)   4★   Rare   Survey
*Efficiency. Grandeur. Dominance. The Vorta Vor encompasses all of these qualities and more. Fitted with an experimental X-72 mining laser and state of the art, ionized dilithium impulse engines, the Vorta Vor excels at extracting materials quickly while attracting as little attention as possible. While the Federation busy themselves defending their mines from the Klingon Empire’s monstrous B’Chor, the Vorta Vor will be securing all of the materials needed to ensure the Romulans maintain their place as the leading force in the galaxy.*

#### LCARS_RESPONSE:
*The Romulans built the Augur class battleships as rapid-response vessels to react to attacks on their territory. These sleek warbirds come packaged with side-mounted disruptors and added armor plates across their wingspan.*
*With hostilities on the rise, the Klingon Empire knows that they will need to protect their precious mining operations. Sneering at the Federation’s trickery and the Romulans’s cowardice, the Empire have designed a ship that will guarantee their economic dominance: The B’Chor. This gargantuan vessel features fourteen compartmentalized cargo holds for storing materials, each one protected by a seven inch Tritanium hull. While their enemies flee at the first sight of danger, the B’Chor will stand strong.*
*The Klingon B’Rel class is a small explorer starship built entirely for short range excursions. Unusually, for a Klingon vessel, it is relatively light on weaponry and does not see a lot of combat maneuvers.*
*The Bortas class battleship is traditionally only found as a part of the Klingon Imperial Fleet and is one of the most recognizable ships in the Empire. Many of the flagships of the Empire over the years have been from this class and they have often been commanded by Chancellors throughout the years.*
*Much like the crew that operated it, the Botany Bay is a relic from humanity’s distant past. Built on Earth in the late 20th century, it was intended to be humanity’s foray into deep space exploration. The vessel’s engines utilized revolutionary nuclear fission technology that was believed to be a completely self-sufficient energy source and its X-25 network array could gather data at an astounding rate.*
*The elite Centurion class is a Romulan explorer most typically found in Imperial fleets. Praetor Bervas was once a General in the fleet and led from a Centurion. The battle that gained him the prestige to stake his claim for leadership of the Star Empire was when he led a squadron into Klingon territory to reclaim the Narendra system, destroying dozens of the Klingon Chancellor’s finest warriors in one ambush.*
*Historically utilized by the Klingon Imperial Defense Force, the D3 class of vessel was used primarily for escort and bombardment missions up until the 2150s. It was then re-classified as an Interceptor and has since been widely adopted as a forward scout. Its nuclear fusion impulse engines allow it to move quickly in and out of danger, and it is armed with light disruptors should it need to engage a foe larger and more heavily armored than itself. While not as well armed as its cousin, the D4 class, the D3 is still a reliable and efficient vessel that should never be underestimated.*
*The iconic Klingon D4 class is a tiny fighter vessel used to intercept and destroy enemies. The D4 has many common uses, such as a troop carrier for infiltration and extraction missions. Squadrons of D4 patrol the surface of Kronos as an elite defense force capable of chasing down, surrounding and eliminating any threat.*
*The Fortunate is an original ECS freighter, built for a high carry capacity and structural integrity at the cost of interior comfort, speed and weapon functionality. As an entry level freighter, the ECS Fortunate is very popular, but limited in its capabilities.*
*The Horizon freighter was part of the ECS's privately owned fleet and used for the transport of all types of goods, ranging from hazardous material to passengers on long-haul journeys. Originally built in the early 22nd century, they started service as pre-warp vessels but have since been maintained and upgraded for low-warp travel.*

ENVOY (Neutral)   2★   Common   Survey
*The Envoy is an advanced ECS freighter with significant improvements over its older cousin, the J-Class. With more cargo holds and better internal systems, the Envoy is equipped for deep space expeditions.*




FERENGI D'VOR (Neutral)   3★   Epic   Survey
*As war between the galaxy’s major factions looms over the horizon, many are left wondering about who will come out on top? What state will our galaxy be in when it ends? Then there are those enterprising few who look past these petty concerns and into profit. For those crafty minds, there is no more suitable vessel than the Ferengi D’Vor. Developed by the renowned Urata Manufacturing as a way to cheat the Latinum exchange, the D’Vor comes mounted with a Dx100 mining laser, configured specifically for the extraction of raw latinum. No other vessel in existence can gather the precious material as efficiently, a testament to the engineering prowess and latinum lust of its creators. In a time of war and strife, nothing will generate profit like the D’Vor. After all, war is good for business.*




GLADIUS (Romulan)   3★   Rare   Interceptor
*The Gladius class interceptor is a classic Romulan design, built for increased mobility and rapid change of direction. The slim hull allows for an increased chance of evading torpedo fire while on an attack run.*




HEGH'TA (Klingon)   4★   Epic   Interceptor
*This Klingon interceptor class was designed with intimidation in mind. Its aggressively shaped wing pylons are intentionally designed to look familiar to Klingon warrior battle armor. The Hegh’Ta usually fight in packs and form a core ingredient of any strong Klingon fleet.*




HIJACKED D3 CLASS (Klingon)   3★   Uncommon   Interceptor
*The Augments were rarely impressed by Klingon technology. It lacked the level of grace and efficiency that they were used to in their own weaponry. However, even they could not ignore the technical ingenuity put into the D3 vessel. An older ship once thought to be obsolete, the D3 was refitted and repurposed by the Klingons into a great power. For the Augments, there was no better metaphor for their own experience in this strange, new galaxy.*




HIJACKED LEGIONARY (Romulan)   3★   Uncommon   Battleship
*In true Romulan fashion, the Legionary class Battleship was slowly phased out of frontline service in favor of the more powerful Augur class. While they were quick to abandon this robust and reliable vessel, the Augments were more than happy to adopt it for their own forces. The Augments know the true value of underestimated technology, and nothing is a better example than the Legionary.*




HIJACKED USS MAYFLOWER (Federation)   3★   Uncommon   Explorer
*For the Augments, the opportunity to turn Starfleet’s technology against them was a satisfying turn of events. Their new Mayflower flies Augment colors, a blatant insult to their most hated enemies. Joaquin took the time to update the Mayflower’s nacelles, greatly reducing power drain during long voyages.*




ISS JELLYFISH (Neutral)   4★   Rare   Explorer
*The ISS Jellyfish is a testament to the technological prowess of the Terran Empire. Far more versatile than its counterpart in our universe, this Jellyfish uses an experimental dark matter warp drive, capable of travelling vast distances quickly and without appearing on enemy scanners. Originally intended as an espionage vessel, it would allow the Empire to spy on its allies and root out dissent before it began. It is also equipped with powerful T-38 Disruptor cannons, making it more than capable of wiping out rebellious activity whenever it is encountered.

The ISS Jellyfish was to be the pride of the Terran Empire, a symbol of their cunning and omniscience. However, the Empire never came into possession of the ship. Spock had other plans for his prized creation...*




JELLYFISH (Federation)   2★   Rare   Explorer
*The Jellyfish is a scout ship from the future and another dimension. It was once piloted by Ambassador Spock on his mission to save Romulus from destruction in the Prime reality. Since its arrival in this dimension, the Jellyfish has been extensively studied by Federation scientists for its extremely advanced technology. Despite it being a high-tech vessel, the Jellyfish was designed as a science vessel and has relatively weak defenses and is now commonly used as a fast Explorer.*




K'T'INGA (Klingon)   4★   Uncommon   Battleship
*A sister class of ship to the Bortas, the K’T’inga is a Klingon battleship with huge arsenal of torpedo launchers. The main launcher is positioned right at the central section of the bow, below the bridge, giving the Captain of each K’T’inga as close a view of every volley from the main launcher.*

K'VORT (Klingon)   3★   Rare   Survey
*The Klingons retrofitted a standard cargo hauler with design improvements from an early human transport vessel to create their new warp-capable Survey vessels.*




KEHRA (Neutral)   3★   Common   Interceptor
*The Kehra is a Tellarite interceptor named after one of the moons that orbits Tellar Prime. These vessels were at the forefront of the Tellarite conflict with the Andorians and later the Romulan Star Empire in the mid 22nd century. The Kehra has gone through few iterations over the following century and is still one of the main designs in use by the Tellarites in their local defense forces.*




KORINAR (Klingon)   4★   Rare   Explorer
*The central column of strength in the Klingon Defense Force, the Korinar class is most prevalent in the Kronos system as the eyes and ears of the Chancellor in local space. A formidable reactionary vessel, the Korinar is a strong all-rounder.*




KUMARI (Neutral)   3★   Common   Battleship
*The Kumari is an Andorian battle cruiser class named after the legendary Andorian Imperial Guard ship that assisted Earth’s mission to unravel the mystery of the Xindi in 2153.

Families and communities were born and raised on vessels of this class for generations and an entire network of trade ships has grown over the years.*

Marla McGivers - Rare
Marla McGivers was one of Starfleet’s top historians and a specialist in the late-20th century Eugenics Wars. This put her in a rather unique position; she is one of the only people in the galaxy to know of Khan’s true history.

Marla was appalled by Starfleet’s treatment of Khan during his trial and subsequent sentencing. To her, Khan was the greatest discovery in the history of the Federation. Shortly after Khan was imprisoned once more, Marla handed in her resignation. She couldn’t possibly stay with an organization that would spit in the face of discovery.

Marla now works with the Augments, attempting to act as their link to modern humanity. As the only one of them who truly understands this new galaxy, Marla has proven herself a valuable ally to the Augments.

However, the war was not finished and Burnham still had a part to play. She was brought aboard the USS Discovery to serve under Captain Gabriel Lorca. She would pay off her debt to society by helping him win the war against the Klingons.

Lorca gave her the greatest gift she ever could have received... Something to fight for. Michael has come to see the Discovery’s crew as her own family and will stop at nothing to defend them.

Navi - Rare
Exceptional from birth, Navi was one of the chosen few to be subjected to the Augment experiments of the 1990s. However, unlike many of her fellow subjects, she managed to retain her humanity, compassion, and level-headedness.
Navi and Khan quickly became friends during the experiments and their subsequent training. Where Khan was equal parts calculating and raw fury, Navi was compassionate and calm. She acted as a positive influence on Khan and was often the only one who could talk him down.
After Khan freed Navi from her cryosleep, she saw immediately that he was in desperate need of her counsel. He had become consumed by rage and his desire for vengeance. Only she could pull him back from the brink of darkness.
Of course, she is still willing to bend the rules as necessary, if it means that she can better serve Khan and her Augment family, so long as it does not involve cruelty or unnecessary violence.

The untimely efforts of Ambassador Spock to contain the supernova that engulfed his planet resulted in the creation of an artificial black hole, which created this offshoot reality. On arrival, Nero's vessel, the Narada, was heavily damaged in combat with the USS Kelvin, leaving Nero and his crew stranded.

Nero lost his family when the disaster occurred and on that day, promised himself retribution against Spock for his failure.

Next Gen Crusher - Common
Having lost her parents as a child, Beverly Crusher had to become independent at an early age, an independence that left her feeling isolated and unable to relate to children in her age group. She became inspired to pursue medicine after witnessing her grandmother use organic remedies to treat those wounded in the tragic disaster on the Arvada III colony.

While she doesn’t always think before speaking, Crusher has worked hard to become more conscious of others’ feelings, knowing how important her bedside manner will be as she pursues her medical career. Now, as part of Starfleet, she has been identified as one of the most promising up-and-coming doctors in the academy.

Next Gen Data - Common
Data is a Soong-type android, the fifth of six developed by Dr. Noonien Soong. Deactivated and abandoned by his creator, he was eventually found by the USS Tripoli on Omicron Theta. With Starfleet realizing Data’s potential upon reactivation, and the android searching for a purpose, he was admitted into the Starfleet Academy.

Despite excelling scholastically, as well as in all physical examinations, Data still found himself dealing with major obstacles that threatened his Starfleet career, facing prejudice from some of the other cadets and officers, as well as struggling with the social and psychological elements of his training. However, Data is determined to overcome these challenges to become the most effective Starfleet officer he can be.

Next Gen La Forge - Common
Geordi La Forge is no stranger to overcoming adversity, having dealt with a birth defect that left him blind. Upon receiving his first VISOR at the age of eight which allowed him to see for the first time in his life, he became fascinated with the inner workings of its technology, as well as all technology around him.

La Forge’s thirst for knowledge, along with his natural talent for engineering has made him a stand-out in his academy class. With his specializations in antimatter power and Dilithium regulators – subjects that often confound even the most experienced of engineers – Geordi has already garnered a reputation as something of a wunderkind in his field.

Next Gen Riker - Common
With ancestors that include Thaddius Riker, a Union Army Colonel, William Riker’s family name gave him a lot to live up to. Raised by his father in the harsh Tundra of Alaska, Riker dreamed of a life in Starfleet as a child, craving adventure and excitement that Alaska simply couldn’t give him.

Despite his natural charisma and talent for decision making, his now-strained relationship with his father has left Riker with something of a rebellious streak, as he constantly clashes with his peers and his commanding officers. And with his middling performance in Starfleet Academy belying his lofty ambitions, Riker will need to shape up if he wants to achieve his ultimate goal of becoming a Starfleet Captain.

Next Gen Troi - Common
An aspiring Starfleet counsellor, Deanna Troi is half Betazoid and half Human, and has extra-sensory empathy, giving her a keen insight into the emotional state of those around her. However, her ability is limited when it comes to beings with different brain structures to Humans and Betazoids, and so she spends as much time as she can studying the psychology of unfamiliar species.

Having suffered through tragedy at an early age from the loss of her sister, Troi chose to dedicate her life to helping others through loss and trauma, and help heal those who have suffered emotional damage. With an unmatched sense of compassion, and a penchant for quick thinking and decision making, Troi can be a tremendous asset for Starfleet.

Nine of Ten - Uncommon
When the USS Sterling went missing in action at the borders of Borg-occupied space, Cadet Gonzales was among the first crew assigned to investigate the ship’s disappearance. However, it was not long before members of this search party were greeted with the same fate as the Sterling’s crew - a forced, painful assimilation into the Borg Collective. Lucia Gonzales is dead. All that remains is Nine of Ten, Septenary Adjunct of Unimatrix Twelve.

One of Ten - Rare
An engineer assigned to active duty aboard the USS Westchester, Daniel Morgan was a promising young officer with a potentially bright future in Starfleet Operations. However, when the Westchester encountered the Borg in the mid 23rd century, this future was irrevocably altered. With his fellow crewmates quickly assimilated into the Borg Collective, Morgan was the last to undergo this procedure. With a fateful last-minute intervention from a Starfleet rescue fleet, the assimilation of Morgan was interrupted and he was returned to the care of the Federation. With both the memories and scars of the incident now a part of him for the rest of his life, Morgan uses his brief experience as part of the Collective in order to combat the Borg threat.

Origins Burnham - Uncommon
A true prodigy, Commander Michael Burnham was raised by Ambassador Sarek on the Vulcan homeworld. She was intended to act as a bridge between Vulcan and human societies, a living testament to the potential of both species. Unfortunately, anti-human bias among the elite prevented Michael from ascending as far as she deserved.

Crestfallen, Michael elected instead to enlist in Starfleet, where she was put under the command of one Captain Phillipa Georgiou, of the USS Shenzhou. Burnham and Georgiou formed a strong bond, and Michael eventually earned a place at Captain Georgiou's right hand, as her first officer.

Origins Saru - Common
Lieutenant Saru was born to a life of constant fear. His people, the Kelpiens, are a prey species on their home planet of Kaminar. No strangers to death, the Kelpiens have evolved to sense the presence of danger, a trait which has brought Saru no shortage of success... and pain.

Saru did not share his people's apathy toward their place in the ecosystem. He resented being prey and sought to find a way out. Utilizing some broken alien technology, he managed to send a message out to the void, hoping that someone would hear it. Someone did.

Captain Philippa Georgiou of the USS Shenzhou was impressed by Saru's ingenuity and his bravery. So impressed that she broke several Starfleet laws and offered him a place on her crew.

Saru has spent the years since tirelessly working to earn the respect of his peers. He has risen through the ranks of Starfleet and was even assigned to the Shenzhou bridge as its Science Officer.

Origins Stamets - Common
When one thinks of a 'genius', they probably imagine someone very much like Paul Stamets. Trained as an astromycologist, Stamets sought to shatter conventional thinking around biology and physics. In fact, he did not believe in the concept of biology and physics as separate sciences. He believed in biology as physics. He believed that to truly advance humanity, one needed to transcend traditional wisdom and expand the borders of scientific discovery. 
To that end, he and his research partner Straal began work on a project - A new technology that would change the galaxy as we know it. Combining astrobiology with astroengineering, they set out to create a new method of space travel, one that would utilize a renewable fuel source to send ships farther than they ever could before, at speeds no-one thought possible.

Otto - Uncommon
Otto is a genetically engineered human Augment and one of Khan’s most trusted lieutenants. Out of all of the augments, he has always been among the physically strongest. His tenacity, savagery, and ruthlessness are matched only by Khan himself.

Like the rest of his Augment family, Otto was put into a cryogenic sleep when they fled the Earth in 1996. He was not awoken by Starfleet. Instead, he was used as emotional leverage against Khan, a fact that enrages Otto to this day.

Now that he is free, Otto is eager to unleash 300 years of unspent aggression and bloodlust on an unsuspecting galaxy.

Pan - Rare
Pan, like all of the Augments, was taken from his family as a child and subjected to experimentation in the 1990s. However, Pan’s body reacted badly to the DNA resequencing. Where Khan and the other survivors were rewarded with heightened reflexes, incredible strength and superhuman intelligence, Pan was left in a coma.
He was kept alive on life support while comatose, and was eventually saved and cryogenically frozen with Khan and the other Augments.
Now, he has been awoken from his coma, after two hundred years, to a completely new world and a startling new set of abilities. He has struggled to come to terms with his new skills and the vast array of incredible technologies this universe has to offer. He has even been known to cause catastrophic ship failures due to his lack of experience and general clumsiness.

Paul Stamets - Rare
When, in generations to come, students at Starfleet Academy study the brightest minds in Federation history, one name will stand out from all others; Paul Stamets.

A genius in every sense of the word, Stamets rose through the ranks of Starfleet based on his masteries of biology, physics and quantum mechanics. He, along with a beloved friend, created technologies that would propel Starfleet to even greater heights, but none more so than his patented Spore Drive.

When the war started, this marvelous technology was co-opted by Starfleet and pressed into service against the Klingons. Stamets loathed the idea of his creation being mishandled by incompetent warmongers and so insisted on managing the technology himself.

Since then, he has seen the Discovery through countless unwinnable battles and treacherous situations, always counting on his brilliant mind to carry them to victory.

The Dupont name carries with it an immense weight. Socialites, artists, leaders. In France, the Dupont name is royalty.
So it is fair to say that Raphaël Dupont, second son of esteemed artist Aumier Dupont, had something of an advantage over his peers.
Given the best education his father could provide, Raphaël proved to be something of a prodigy of mathematics. His grasp of thermodynamics and theoretical physics would earn him high praise in the academic field. However, he quickly grew bored of the endless stream of peer reviews and university lectures. He found himself enthralled by tales of material miners beyond Federation space. He longed for the danger, the adrenaline, the freedom! But instead, he was stuck on Earth, bound by Federation laws and regulation. He had had enough. It was time for him to forge his own path.

A billionaire in his previous life, Rima is the only human who voluntarily signed up to be part of the Augment experiments, believing himself to be a prime specimen for such procedures. 

At the height of the Augments’ power, Rima committed himself to regaining the wealth he had lost along the way. He remained neutral during the Eugenics Wars, using stealth tactics and his natural cunning to stay alive.

However, once the humans started rounding up the last surviving Augments, Rima was faced with the reality that his horde of wealth was about to collapse yet again and soon found himself allied with Khan.

While he is still a loyal member of Khan’s crew, he has never lied about his true intentions

 to rebuild the financial empire he once sat atop.

Even the Romulan Empire, with all of its power, cannot stop the unrelenting Borg assault. In the initial days of the invasion, the Romulans were content to watch from the sidelines as their enemies were assimilated, relying on their famed defensive fleets and intelligence agencies to protect them. They were mistaken. Decius, once a proud leader in the Romulan military, was taken captive by the Borg during a routine patrol of the Neutral Zone border. They had no warning and no chance of victory against a Borg Cube. He was subjected to the horrifying assimilation process and was forced to turn his brilliant strategic mind against his homeworld.
